# Quantitative-Derivatives-Models
A repository containing a collection of Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and other code artifacts related to the modeling and analysis of derivative instruments using quantitative methods. This repository serves as a resource for different quantitative models in exploring and implementing various derivative pricing models, risk management techniques, and quantitative strategies.

The repository covers a wide range of topics within the field of quantitative finance, including but not limited to:

1. Implementation of popular derivative pricing models such as Black-Scholes, Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR), and Heston models.
2. Monte Carlo simulation methods for pricing and risk analysis of derivatives.
3. Numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in derivative pricing.
4. Sensitivity analysis and hedging strategies for managing derivative portfolio risk.
5. Backtesting and validation of derivative pricing models using historical data.


Welcome to the Quantitative Derivatives Framework, a curated repository containing of Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and analytical tools related to modeling, pricing, and analysis of derivative instruments through quantitative methods. This repository serves as a dynamic resource for students, researchers, finance professionals, and enthusiasts interested in exploring, understanding and implementing various derivatives models, risk mitigation strategies using computational techniques.

#### üîç Contents
This repository contains various models in the field of quantitative finance implementations and explorations of:

1. Black-Scholes, Binomial Tree Models (eg. Cox-Ross-Rubinstein), and Stochastic Volatility Models (eg. Heston).
2. Monte Carlo simulation methods for option pricing and risk analysis.
3. Numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDE) solvers for European and barrier options.
4. Greeks computation and dynamic hedging strategies for portfolio risk.
5. Model calibration using backtesting of historical financial data.
6. Jump Diffusion Models: Merton model to account for sudden market moves.
7. Regime-Switching Frameworks: Models that adapt based on market volatility clusters.
8. Stochastic volatility processes: Variance Gamma or SABR Models.
